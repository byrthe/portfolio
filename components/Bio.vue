            Hello there!<br>
            From November '21 onwards I'm open for work. <a href="mailto:byrthelemmens@gmail.com">Feel free to reach out to me.</a><br><hr>
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            I am an experienced graphic designer (freelance since 2013) and a junior front-end developer based in Brussels. I like to work with Adobe Suite, Vue, Nuxt, Javascript, Sass and CSS frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap. And I'm currently diving deeper into Javascript, Typescript and animations.<br><br>
            Due to my long experience as a freelancer and involvement with collective projects such as <a href="http://www.mothersanddaughters.be" target="blank">Mothers & Daughters</a>, I'm also experienced at project management and a reliable team player.<br><br>
            I studied graphic design at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam (2007â€“2012) and am currently studying web development at BeCode (april until november 2021).
